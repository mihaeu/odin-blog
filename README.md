# Odin Blog

This project uses Odin to make it super easy to generate a blog from static files written in Markdown (or other formats of your choice).

If you know Jekyll or Pelican, this aims to be similar, but PHP.

**NOTE: This is under heavy construction and right now I would not recommend anyone to try this out. Try Jekyll/Octopress (Ruby), Pelican (Python), or Assemble (NodeJS) instead. I love all of them and they inspired this project quite a bit.**
